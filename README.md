# Time Trial V1.1
[GAME LINK](https://jesser4.github.io/TimeTrial/)

This reposity contains the WebGL build of the game from unity. This was my first attempt (May 2023) at making a unity game unguided.

The site is deployed via GitHub Pages and can be found [here](https://jesser4.github.io/TimeTrial/).

### Future Updates and Ideas
 - The game should scale to window size
 - Indicate invalid run immidietly after missing checkpoint rather then on the next checkpoint crossed
 - Rubber trail behind the car when turning hard
 - Some sort of inticator when at full speed
 - Soundeffects / Background music
 - Global Leaderboards
 - Muliplayer?
